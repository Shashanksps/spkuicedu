    <p class="detel">
        
 My name is Shashank Prasanna and Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Management and Information Systems at the University of Illinois at Chicago My coursework 
has provided me with a robust foundation in areas crucial to modern business, including Advanced Database Management, Enterprise 
Application Development, supply chain management and Operation Management.I am a professional with over three years of experience in the management and consulting fields.<br>
<br>
<br>
My educational journey began at M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology in Bangalore, India, where I earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, completing the program from July 2015 
to July 2019.My career path has included positions at prestigious companies, all of which have greatly enhanced my diverse skill set.
At Infosys, as an Associate Consultant, I collaborated closely with senior consultants and developers to enhance application efficiency
and successfully minimized client complaints. My adeptness at resolving tech issues contributed to a 50% reduction in overall issue 
resolution time, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction. Subsequently, as a Senior Executive at Flipkart, I spearheaded projects 
aimed at streamlining operations and implementing real-time MIS reports. Notably, my initiative led to a 30% reduction in project timelines 
and a substantial increase in operational efficiency. I also undertook projects for productivity improvement. <br>
<br>
<br>

My tenure at Reliance Retail Limited further honed my skills in operational optimization. Conducting a comprehensive audit of the supply chain, I identified key areas 
for improvement that culminated in an increase in efficiency and a 20% reduction in inventory costs. Noteworthy publications and presentations,
such as my research on "Effect of Drilling Parameters on Kevlar Delamination," have significantly contributed to the academic discourse, resulting 
in tangible enhancements in drilling efficiency and reduced delamination risks. Outside of academics and professional engagements, I have taken on 
leadership roles in organizing cultural fests and actively participated in volunteer activities, demonstrating a commitment to community engagement
and leadership development. Moreover, my technical acumen spans various programming languages, data analytics tools, and business/software applications, 
including C++, SQL, R-programming, Tableau, Python, and an array of enterprise systems such as Ansys, AutoCAD, SAP, Oracle EBS suite, and JavaScript.<br>

In summary, my comprehensive academic background, coupled with extensive hands-on experience across diverse domains, positions me as a dynamic and 
resourceful professional capable of driving innovation, operational excellence, and transformative change in any organizational setting.
